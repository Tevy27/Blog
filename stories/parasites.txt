In a modest home, nestled in the heart of a bustling city, lived a woman named Alina. With a life marked by quiet endurance, she carried the weight of her family with a tender but tired heart. Alina's world revolved around her four daughters, each a beacon of kindness, diligently weaving joy into the tapestry of her everyday life. They were her pride, her joy, and the source of all her comfort. They never caused her grief, instead, they shouldered her burdens as their own, ensuring she never felt alone.

Yet, in stark contrast to her daughters' warmth, Alina's brothers loomed like shadows of discontent. They were distant figures, bound to her only by blood, not by affection or duty. These men, whom she once played with in the innocence of childhood, had grown into strangers with insatiable needs. They surfaced only in moments of greed, their hands outstretched, not to offer help, but to take. They saw Alina not as a sister to be cherished but as a means to an end, a reservoir from which to draw, never to replenish.

When illness tethered Alina to the sterile whites of a hospital bed, her daughters were her constant vigil, a circle of strength and love. Yet, her brothers remained phantoms of concern. One was engulfed in his own life, his silence a stark reminder of the growing chasm between them. The other, audacious in his disregard, called not to inquire about her health but to request money for a new motorbike, his words striking her ailing heart with disbelief and sorrow.

The relentless requests for money became a dark cloud over Alina's life, a constant source of anxiety and unrest. She lay awake at nights, the moon bearing witness to her silent tears, her mind a battlefield of maternal love and fraternal disillusionment. The thought of burdening her daughters, her precious lights in the darkness, with the parasitic demands of her brothers tormented her. She felt trapped in a cycle of dependency and disappointment, each request for money a reminder of the stark disparity between the love she received from her daughters and the selfishness exuded by her siblings.

In the quiet of her room, Alina often pondered the strange twist of fate that made her brothers so different from her daughters. Where her daughters were selfless, her brothers were self-serving; where her daughters brought peace, her brothers sowed discord. Yet, in the depth of her despair, Alina found a resilient hope, a quiet determination to shield her daughters from the parasitic grasp of her siblings. She resolved to break the cycle, to sever the ties that bound her to expectation and guilt. For in her heart, she knew that the love of her daughters was her true wealth, a treasure no amount of money could ever replace.
