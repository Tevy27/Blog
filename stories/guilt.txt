His life was a portrait of potential: a university student with dreams as vast as the starlit sky that blanketed his town each night. But one fateful evening, that sky became a shroud.

The night was thick with celebration, the air buzzing with the intoxication of youth and freedom. He swept up in the revelry, felt invincible. Laughter echoed in his ears as he stumbled to his car, the world tilting slightly with each step. He assured himself he could manage—the roads would be empty, the drive short.

Behind the wheel, the clarity of the night was smeared into a haze. The dashboard lights blurred into streaks of color as he navigated the sleeping streets, his confidence as misplaced as the bottle that lay empty in the passenger seat.
 
It happened in a heartbeat—the thud against the car, a sound dreadfully solid, and a child's silhouette spinning into the void. Time fractured. He froze, the gravity of reality piercing the alcohol-induced fog. Panic clawed at his insides, a primal fear that choked rational thought. 

He made a decision that would haunt him for the rest of his life—he fled, not just the scene but everything he knew. Abroad, the sun never seemed to shine as bright, the shadows clinging to him, heavy with the weight of his guilt. Drink was no longer a friend but a reminder, each sip a bitter echo of that night.

In the shadowy corners of a life unrecognizable, he withered, his name unknown in this self-imposed exile. The guilt that writhed within him was a relentless tormentor, a reminder of a moment marred by the irreversible. He attempted to stitch together the semblance of a normal life, each action mechanically aligned with the motions of the living, but he was merely a ghost haunting his own existence.

He sat in crowded rooms where laughter was a language he could no longer speak, the sound grating against the raw edges of his conscience. At night, he lay in the embrace of solitude, the darkness of his room less profound than the shadows in his heart. His secret, a heavy anchor, kept him at the depths of despair, away from the light of absolution.

His days were penance, each breath a struggle against the tide of self-reproach. He tried to mingle with faces that never became familiar, to speak words that felt like shards of glass on his tongue. The mask of normalcy was brittle, fracturing with every feigned smile, every nod, every hollow greeting.

The child's memory haunted him, a spectre at every corner, in every accidental touch of strangers who might have been kind, had they known his name, his shame. The world moved on around him, but he was stuck, trapped in the amber of that catastrophic moment.

Unable to escape the maelstrom of his guilt, he was a prisoner of his own making. The weight of the life he had taken pressed down on him with unbearable force. His existence became a daily battle with the agony of what he had done, and in the end, the burden proved too heavy to carry. Alone and nameless, he faded, consumed by the silent scream of guilt that would never be silenced.
